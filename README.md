# Advanced Microprocessors' Lab Exersices
### This Lab is part of Department of Computer Engineering & Informatics, University of Patras and connected with Advanced Microprocessors

The exersices were based on the **AVR-IoT Wx** Development Board and **ATmega4808** microcontroller. The simulation was done using **Michrochip Studio**.

In the lab we learned the following in each exersice:
- How to program a microchip using interrupts and Interrupt Service Routines (ISR)
- How to use an Analog to Digital Converter
- How to use a counter as a Pulse Width Modulator
- Last exersice combined all of the above
